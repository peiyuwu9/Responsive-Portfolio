            Hello everyone, thank you for visiting my website. In the cool website, I would like share basic of myself. <br><br>
            I came from a normal family supported by a samll tea business. I had been a behavior kid who never made big trouble, which sounds like I am a boring person.
            However, my life started changing after I decided to come far away from my country to United States. I met people from different background and culture. That's really blow my mind.
            In stead of lingering between viedo games and physics, I explored many more interets in these few years such as Crossfit, mountain climbing, electronic dance music, etc. There are more I did not memtion.
            All these activities enrich my life to ectend I never expected. In addition, by working with people from all over the world, social skills twist my personalities from shy and individul to be more comfortable to meet new friends and to be a great team player.
            </p>
